# Microscopic-illustrative-unification-to-discern-malaria

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Malaria is a major global health threat. Malaria could be prevented, controlled, and cured
more effectively if a more accurate and efficient diagnostic method were available. Thus to propose
an automated procedure that will detect this health threat in much easier and faster manner is the
ultimate goal of Microscopic illustrative unification to discern malaria. The main aim of this malaria
detection system is to address the challenges in the existing system by automating the process of
malaria detection using Machine learning and image processing.
